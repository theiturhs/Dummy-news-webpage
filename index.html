                    <p>Avraham Eisenberg, the crypto investor whose “ highly profitable trading strategy ”
                        drained DeFi trading platform Mango Markets of crypto worth $110 million, was
                        arrested Monday in Puerto Rico, court documents said.
                        The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’
                        treasury shortly after the incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S.
                        resident to face charges for his role in manipulating a decentralized-finance trading
                        platform.</p>
